# What's Cooking?

## Code Institute Milestone Project 2

A responsive website used as a recipe search. Recipes can found using either a main ingredient, a meal or cuisine through an API.

The user will also be able to search using specific requirements such as dietry needs, allergens and intolerances.

The site can be built upon further by adding more features in the future, which could make it a complete weekly planner for cooking and food shopping.
