# What's Cooking

## Code Institute Milestone Project 2

A responsive website used as a recipe search. Recipes can found using ingredients through an API. It'd designed to help users find new recipes to cook involving either their favourite foods or what might be available in the fridge and cupboards.

This is can be helpful to user as a meal planner, which can help the environment as i can reduce food wastage by helping the user use up food thats already been bought.

The site can be built upon further by adding more features in the future, which could make it a complete weekly planner for cooking and food shopping.
